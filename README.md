Learning data analysis tools

This is a quick reference guide for me. 

After learning some tools to build something, I usually do not use them for some time. Then I forget about them. Or some important features I learned then I forget. These notebooks can bring me back to speed without going through google searches or documentations.

## Table of contents
- `python_for_data_analysis` directory is my notes from reading [Python for Data Analysis](https://wesmckinney.com/book/) by Wes McKinney.

- `R` directory has data analysis in r language. Learning about statistics and bioinformatics.
